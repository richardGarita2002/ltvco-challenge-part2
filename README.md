# URL Shortener Web Application

Project made as part 2 of the LTVco challenge completed by Richard Garita.

## How It Works

### Viewing Top 100 URLs

1. Navigate to the homepage.
2. The top 100 most frequently accessed URLs are displayed, paginated with 20 URLs per page.
3. Use the navigation buttons at the bottom to move between pages.

### Adding a URL

1. Click on the "Add URL" button in the header.
2. A modal will open with a form to add a URL.
3. Enter the full URL into the input field.
4. The "Generate" button will be enabled only if a valid URL is entered.
5. Click "Generate" to shorten the URL.
6. Once the shorten URL is generated, it will be displayed in the modal.
7. Close the modal by clicking the 'X' button in the top-right corner.

## About the Project

This project is the client-side implementation of a URL shortener web application. It allows users to shorten URLs and view the top 100 most frequently accessed URLs. The application is built using React.js for frontend development, Axios for making HTTP requests, Font Awesome Icons and React Bootstrap for UI components.
